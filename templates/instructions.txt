DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Project files have been written to the copilot/ directory.  Any changes to these files should be committed to github.

Run the following commands to bootstrap the app:

NOTE:
1. you will need to export the AWS_PROFILE env var for the copilot cli tool to pick up:  export AWS_PROFILE=your-aws-profile
2. the {{ domain }} hosted zone needs to be set up in the AWS account you are deploying into.  Speak to SRE for assistance.
3. Production environments will need an ACM TLS cert setting up before they can be deployed.  Speak to SRE for assistance.

You do not need to follow all of the instructions in sequence. For instance, you may decide to just initialise and deploy one environment, and then deploy a single service into that environment.

# 1. init the app

copilot app init --domain {{ domain }}

# 2. init each service
{% for service in services %}
copilot svc init --name {{ service.name }}
{%- endfor %}

# 3. Add the WAF acl to each environment

Edit the waf.yml file for each environment and replace "replace-with-waf-acl-arn" with the WAF ACL ARN.

{% for env_name, _ in environments.items() %}
copilot/{{ env_name }}/addons/waf.yml
{%- endfor %}

# 4. initialise each environment

When running "copilot env init" chose the following options:
* Credential source: the correct account that the env should exist in. [NOTE: environments can live in separate accounts.]
* Default environment configuration? Yes, use default.

{% for env_name, _ in environments.items() %}
copilot env init --name {{ env_name }}
{%- endfor %}

# 5. deploy each environment
{% for env_name, _ in environments.items() %}
copilot env deploy --name {{ env_name }}
{%- endfor %}

# 6. migrate the secrets from Gov Paas to AWS/Copilot

copilot-bootstrap.py migrate_secrets {{ config_file }}

You need to be authenticated via the CF CLI for this command to work.
Use the --dry-run flag initially to check the output

# 7. deploy each service into each environment
{%- for service in services %}

# {{ service.name }}:
{%- for env_name, _ in environments.items() %}
copilot svc deploy --name {{ service.name }} --env {{ env_name }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Edit each copilot/{service-name}/manifest.yaml file and replace the image_location with the service's ECR registry url and redeploy.
